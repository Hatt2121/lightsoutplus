LightsOut+ &#9635;
=================

This is an attempt to make lights out as close to hardware as possible, and to add a couple of features.

## Planned Features
* Adding variable sized boards up to player's choice
* Adding more flipping areas (Not just a 3x3)
* Making it more efficient //Is already in the works
* Implement a solver (with the other developer's permission of course)
* Uses Emoji and Unicode characters
* Maybe make a version that works with browsers? In Web Assembly? (would be fun to figure out I guess...)

## Todo
1. Make it work... like actually
    1. ~~Find a way to see the string as a string of unicode characters, not just strings of bits.~~
    2. Find a way to randomize the board (could be as simple as chosing a random number).
    3. Figure out how I want the player to interact with the game through a CLI.
    4. Figure out how I want the player to interact with the game through a GUI (optional).
    5. Implement turn counts and add difficulty. (Difficulty comes with limiting the player... wait... does it?)
    7. Implement a modular way to put in more features at will without hurting my brain.
2. Implement Planned Features
